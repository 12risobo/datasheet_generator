## Best Practices for Code Refactoring (2/13/2025, 1:57:13 PM)

_**User**_

I want to start refactoring my code, which model is best for doing this?

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Okay, the user wants to refactor their Python code and is asking which model is best for that. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what refactoring involves. It's about restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve readability, maintainability, or efficiency. So the user probably wants tools or methods to help with this.

The user mentioned "which model is best," so they might be referring to AI models or code analysis tools. Since they're using Python, I should consider linters, formatters, and static analyzers. These tools can automatically check and refactor code according to best practices.

Black and isort are popular for formatting. Black reformats code to a consistent style, and isort sorts imports. Flake8 or Pylint can catch style issues and potential errors. For more advanced refactoring, like renaming variables or extracting methods, Rope or Jedi might be useful. These are libraries that enable refactoring capabilities in IDEs.

Also, the user's code has a lot of ReportLab logic, so maybe suggesting type hints could help with maintainability. Using mypy alongside could catch type-related issues.

I should list these tools, explain their purposes, and offer to help implement any of them. The user might not know which one to start with, so providing options and asking if they need help with a specific refactoring step would be good.

Wait, the user's code is quite lengthy. Maybe they want to start with something basic like formatting. I should mention Black first since it's straightforward. Then, if they want more structural changes, suggest linters and static analyzers.

Also, considering the context, the user might be looking for an AI-powered tool. In that case, GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT could assist in suggesting refactors, but traditional tools are more reliable for automatic changes.

So, the answer should outline both AI-based and traditional tools, explain their uses, and offer further assistance based on the user's specific needs.

For code refactoring tasks, you have several good options depending on your needs:

1. **Built-in Python Tools** (best for immediate use):
```python
# Key tools to consider:
- Black (automatic code formatting)
- isort (imports organization)
- flake8 (style guide enforcement)
- pylint (static code analysis)
- mypy (type checking)
- rope (refactoring library)
```

2. **AI-Powered Options** (I can help with):
- I can assist with structural refactoring while maintaining context
- Can help with:
  - Breaking down large functions/methods
  - Improving naming conventions
  - Simplifying complex conditionals
  - Adding type hints
  - Creating helper functions
  - Improving documentation
  - Suggesting design pattern implementations

3. **Recommended First Steps** for your current code:
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Break up the large `generate_datasheet` function into smaller methods
- Create a configuration class for styling constants
- Add docstrings to all functions/methods
- Implement proper error handling

Would you like me to help implement any of these refactoring steps? For example, we could start by:
1. Creating a `PdfConfig` class for styling constants
2. Breaking the 100-line `generate_datasheet` into logical components
3. Adding proper type hints throughout

Which aspect would you like to tackle first?

_**User**_

Can you look at main.py and give me suggestions on how to refactor the code?

_**Assistant**_

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to refactor their main.py code. I need to look at the provided code and figure out the best ways to improve it.

First, I'll start by scanning through the code to identify common refactoring opportunities. The generate_datasheet function is really long, over 100 lines. That's a red flag for being too complex. Breaking that down into smaller functions would make it more manageable.

Next, I notice there are a lot of magic numbers and hard-coded values, like the table width being 73% of the doc width. These should be extracted into constants or a configuration class to improve readability and maintainability.

The code uses repeated styles for tables. For example, table_style and table_style_items have similar settings. Creating a helper function to generate these styles would reduce redundancy.

Type hints are missing in most function definitions. Adding them would make the code clearer and help with static type checking.

Error handling is present in some places but could be more consistent. Maybe wrapping file operations in try-except blocks or improving exception messages would help.

There's some duplicated code when handling SVG vs. image files in the technical drawing section. Extracting that into a separate function could clean that up.

The WatermarkCanvas class might benefit from having the drawing logic in its own method, and perhaps moving the scaling calculations there to encapsulate that functionality.

The CSV reading function is simple but could include error handling for missing files or invalid data.

The main function loops over products and calls generate_datasheet. It skips the first two rows, which is a bit magic. Adding comments or extracting that into a function would clarify it.

Constants like font paths and style settings are scattered. Grouping these into a config class or module-level constants would centralize their management.

Docstrings are missing for most functions and classes. Adding those would improve documentation.

Considering all these points, the key refactoring steps would be:

1. Break down the large generate_datasheet into smaller functions, each handling a specific part like adding images, creating sections, product info, etc.
2. Create a PdfConfig class to hold styling constants, dimensions, and paths.
3. Add type hints to all function signatures.
4. Extract repeated table styling into a helper function.
5. Improve error handling with more descriptive messages and possibly logging.
6. Add docstrings to explain each function's purpose and parameters.
7. Move CSV reading into a more robust function with error handling.

I should present these suggestions in a clear, step-by-step manner, offering to implement specific parts as the user prefers. Starting with the config class and breaking down the large function would provide immediate benefits, so I'll highlight those as recommended first steps.
</think>

Here are key refactoring suggestions for your `main.py`, starting with the most impactful changes:

1. **Configuration Class** (reduces magic numbers, centralizes styling):
```python:main.py
class PdfConfig:
    PAGE_SIZE = (A4[1], A4[0])  # Landscape
    MARGINS = 25*mm
    FONTS = {
        'regular': 'Calibri',
        'bold': 'Calibri-Bold'
    }
    COLORS = {
        'header': colors.HexColor('#104861'),
        'text': colors.black,
        'footer': colors.grey
    }
    DIMENSIONS = {
        'table_width': 0.73,  # 73% of page width
        'max_image_width': 10.5*inch,
        'max_image_height': 5.25*inch
    }
    SPACING = {
        'paragraph': 10,
        'section': 20,
        'row_padding': 4
    }
```

2. **Function Decomposition** (break up giant generate_datasheet):
```python:main.py
def generate_datasheet(...):  # Keep main flow
    doc = setup_document(product_id, output_dir)
    story = []
    
    story.append(PageBreak())
    add_technical_drawing(story, image_path)
    add_specifications_section(story, specs_data, doc)
    add_product_info_section(story, items_data, doc)
    add_footer(story)
    
    doc.build(story, canvasmaker=WatermarkCanvas)

# Then create separate functions for:
# - setup_document()
# - add_technical_drawing()
# - add_specifications_section()
# - add_product_info_section()
# - add_footer()
```

3. **Style Factory** (reduce style duplication):
```python:main.py
def create_table_style(header_text: str, num_columns: int) -> TableStyle:
    base_style = [
        ('GRID', (0,0), (-1,-1), 1, colors.black),
        ('FONTNAME', (0,0), (-1,-1), PdfConfig.FONTS['regular']),
        ('FONTSIZE', (0,0), (-1,-1), 8),
        ('TOPPADDING', (0,0), (-1,-1), PdfConfig.SPACING['row_padding']),
    ]
    
    if header_text:
        base_style.extend([
            ('SPAN', (0,0), (num_columns-1,0)),
            ('BACKGROUND', (0,0), (num_columns-1,0), PdfConfig.COLORS['header']),
            ('FONTNAME', (0,0), (num_columns-1,0), PdfConfig.FONTS['bold']),
        ])
    
    return TableStyle(base_style)
```

4. **Type Hints** (improve readability and safety):
```python:main.py
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def resize_image(image_path: str, max_width: float, max_height: float) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    ...

def read_csv(file_path: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    ...

class WatermarkCanvas(canvas.Canvas):
    def draw_watermark(self) -> None:
        ...
```

5. **Error Handling Improvements**:
```python:main.py
def generate_datasheet(...):
    try:
        # main logic
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to generate {product_id}: {str(e)}")
        raise  # Or handle cleanup

def read_csv(file_path: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    try:
        with open(file_path, newline='') as csvfile:
            return [row for row in csv.reader(csvfile)]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Missing CSV file: {file_path}")
        return []
```

**Recommended Refactoring Order**:
1. Create the `PdfConfig` class first
2. Add type hints throughout
3. Break up `generate_datasheet` using helper functions
4. Implement the style factory
5. Enhance error handling

Would you like me to implement any of these changes in detail? For example, I can show:
- Full implementation of the `PdfConfig` class integration
- Detailed decomposition of the `generate_datasheet` function
- Complete type hint coverage for a specific section
